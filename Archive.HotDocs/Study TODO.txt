	1. Data structures
	- Array
	- List (Linked lists, Doubly linked list)
	- Stack
	- Queue
	- Binary tree (and balanced and complete trees)
	- Binary Search tree
	- Graphs (Directed and undirected)
	- Maps and Sets
	- Heaps (Min and Max heaps)
	- Union-find
	- Tries

	2. Algorithms
	- Sorting (Quick, merge, bucket)
	- Binary search (Very common)
	- Tree traversal (preorder, in order, post order)
	- BFS and DFS (Very common)
	- Recursion
	- Divide and conquer
	- Greedy
	- Finding all permutations and combinations
	- Dynamic programming

	Others:
	- Bit manipulation
	- String manipulation
	- Basic math (Euclidean distance, long division, integer division and modulus, means and median, prime numbers, Fibonacci series, sum of sequence of numbers)

	Time complexity (Very important)

	Tricky parts:
	- off-by-one errors
	- infinite loops
	- using stringbuilder to build strings
	- Date representation and manipulation
	- integer vs. Double precision
	- overflow
	- divide by zero
	- edge case checking
	- out of range errors
	- too many if/else statements
	- too many nested loops
	- repeated code
	- null pointer exception
