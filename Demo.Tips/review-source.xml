				SDLC and Work process:
			</Title>
			<Data>
				Requirement gathering and analysis, Design, Implementation or coding, Testing, Deployment, Maintenance:  <br />
				- Project preparation discuss resources and the skills needed, apply tranings or self-study if needed, define the sprint period and the story points count, define the branching strategy (pdf)  <br />
				- Kick-Off meeting (Project overview, technical stack, source control, project management tool, hosting platform, deployment approach, etc…)  <br />
				- All team members MUST understand the project business. <br />
				- Code Comments: every class should have a summery about its methods, every method should have a clear description, the class should not have non-related methods <br />
				- Having a standup everyday for 30 minutes <br />
				- Having a grooming meeting (to be recorded) between all the project teams including the business team to set priorities of backlog tickes and clarify and estimate tickets, the estimation include the development and testing efforts <br />
				- One of ticket\task readiness factors is to have a test cases so that the developer can convert it to unit tests, that should be runned every time we do a deployment. <br />
				- Any Commit should have a clear comment that include the ticket number also. <br />
				- Integrate Github with Jira to show the created branch, merge or pull request for each ticket <br />
				- Integrate Jira with WiKI (which contains all project docs and also the grooming recordings) <br />
				- Retrospective meetings: (every 2 weeeks or in general after every sprint) are a great opportunity for people to come together to talk about what went well, what didn’t go so well, and what will be changed for the next sprint, and agree on some action items (decisions) to solve that https://ideaboardz.com/for/Sprint%2035%20Retro/3906034  <br />
				<b>Work process: </b> <br />
				- Create a new Jira Board that define the tickets workflow: TODO > In Progress > Blocked > Code Review > QA > QA Sign Off > UAT > Done <br />
				- DB objects should be added to source control, by creating a DataBase project in Visual Studio <br />
				- Release branch should have some constrains so only the release manager person is the only person who can approve the changes <br />
				- Once you have a ticket, create a feature branch (feature/AS-1234) and start develop <br />
				- Once you finish > create Pull Request from your feature branch to develop branch <br />
				- Once merged to develop, the jenkins job for build and deploy will be auto-triggered to deploy to the QA environment <br />
				- Once we have the QA SignOff, merge between develop and release <br />
				- Once the merge done, it will trigger the jenkins job responsible to deploy to UAT <br />
				- Once deployed to UAT, the business team should validate the ticket <br />
				- Once we have the business team SignOff for all sprint tickets that will be included in the release, we run the jenkins job to deploy to prod from release branch <br />
				- Once the prod deployment done, the QA should run the regression test <br />
				- Once we have the prod SignOff, then merge from release to master and develop branches <br />

				C# memory management:
			</Title>
			<Data>
				C# employs automatic memory management which implemented by a <b>garbage collector</b>, The garbage collector checks to see if there are any objects in the heap that are no longer being used by the application. If such objects exist, then the memory used by these objects can be reclaimed. (If no more memory is available for the heap, then the new operator throws an OutOfMemoryException). <br />
				<b>The managed heap:</b> When an application calls the new operator to create an object, there may not be enough address space left in the region to allocate to the object. The heap detects this by adding the size of the new object to NextObjectPinter. If NextObjectPinter is beyond the end of the address space region, then the heap is full and a collection must be performed.

				<b>Rabbit MQ</b> is a sophisticated server product that provides complex messaging patterns, topics and routing out-of-the-box. You also get centralized management and DR, something you'd have to implement yourself if you chose MSMQ.
				<b>Rabbit MQ Workflow:</b><br/>
				> The producer publishes a message to the exchange. <br/>
